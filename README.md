# Google reCAPTCHA Audio Bypass with Playwright

This project is inspired by [GoogleRecaptchaBypass](https://github.com/sarperavci/GoogleRecaptchaBypass), but instead of using traditional tools like Selenium or Puppeteer, I used **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)** for browser automation and implemented a method to handle **Google reCAPTCHA audio challenges** by **recording and processing the audio files**.

## üß† Overview

This script automates the process of interacting with Google reCAPTCHA by:

1. Launching a browser via **Playwright**
2. Navigating to a target page with reCAPTCHA
3. Detecting when an audio CAPTCHA appears
4. Automatically clicking the audio challenge button
5. Recording the audio file provided by reCAPTCHA
6. (Optional) Processing the audio file (e.g., speech-to-text)
